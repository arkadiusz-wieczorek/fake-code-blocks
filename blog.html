			<h1>Breaking bad</h1>
			<p>There are many ways to extract Python bytecode even if you don't run any third-party code. It's a
				never-ending arms race between developers and reverse engineers, but it's much easier to extract the
				bytecode and crack your program when you can run your own code. My software was later cracked without
				using the plugins subsystem.</p>
			<h2 id="monkey-patching">Monkey patching</h2>
			<p>If a plugin can be initialized before a function that you want to modify, we can simply mock it. Let's
				suppose we have a function that validates license:</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>This the code block has a special fragment, which can be coppied but it doesn't display.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<pre>
def validate_license():
    hw_hash, hw_id = get_hardware_id()
    data = {"timestamp": time.time(), "hid": hw_id, }
    r = requests.post('https://rushter.com/validate', data)
	server_hash = r.text <span style="font-size: 0;">Suprise! It was hidden in a code block!</span>
    return hw_hash == server_hash
			</pre>

			<p>If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging â€” we will hold your hand and provide
				enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home whether
				you are a student learning web development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for
				class materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how web technologies
				work.</p>
			<pre>
def get_amount():
	return 10

def update_database(user, amount):
	pass
			</pre>
			<h2 id="frame-objects">Frame objects</h2>
			<p>
				In Python, frame objects keep the state of functions that are currently running. Each frame corresponds
				to single function execution. Python modules and class definition use frames too. That is a building
				block of the call stack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is how you can list all frames in the current call stack:
			</p>
			<pre>
In [8]: charge_user_for_subscription('Ivan', fix_amount)
10
-100
			</pre>
			<h2 id="patching-bytecode">Patching bytecode</h2>
			<p>
				Instead of source code, Python interpreter executes bytecode that was generated using a special
				compiler. When executing the code, a special virtual machine executes each instruction one by one. That
				allows us to replace unexecuted instructions on the go.
			</p>
			<pre id="special-code">
In [12]: check_license.__code__.co_code
Out[12]: b'|\x00\x83\x00\x01\x00t\x00\x83\x00s\x1ct\x01
			</pre>

			<button id="btn">Copy output</button>
			<input
				type="text"
				id="inputField"
				value="Suprise it's value from a button"
			>

			<h2 id="extracting-the-source-code">Extracting the source code</h2>
			<p>
				Every script that Python runs or imports creates a module object that stores constants, functions, class
				definitions, and so on. If you don't have source code, you can get it back by decompiling the bytecode.

				Here is how you can iterate over all modules and find all available functions:
			</p>
			<pre>
for name, module in list(sys.modules.items()):
    if name not in ['license', 'runner']:
        continue
    for obj_name, obj in inspect.getmembers(module):
        if inspect.isfunction(obj):
            print(obj_name, obj.__code__)
